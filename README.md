# OpenKDVManager
This is going to be a sample application consisting of multiple services.

## Architecture
TODO: Add image

## Services
The are two service each having their own responsibility:
- Users
  Will contain user data such as name
- Planning
  Will contain a planning on which time the user is available

## API
Since we don't want the frontend directly talking to the backend we need to implement an api gateway.

## Frontend
Since we have an api only backend the frontend is going to be servered seperatly.
